initSidebarItems({"mod":[["auth","Whenever you create a `RedditClient`, you need to provide an `Authenticator` that can log in for you and send credentials with every request. Reddit's API provides multiple ways to authenticate, and it's important that you use the correct one for your application so that you only take passwords where necessary. # OAuth Or Not? In effect, Reddit's API is split into two parts: a deprecated API that uses cookies for authentication, and an OAuth API that is recommended for new applications. Clients that use OAuth-based authenticators have a higher rate limit (60/min for OAuth, 30/min for cookie), so it may be preferable to use OAuth if larger batches of data are being processed from the API. # Authenticator Summary - `AnonymousAuthenticator` - uses the legacy API (so it has a lower rate limit) but requires no credentials at all. Choose this if you just want to **browse the API without registering**. - `PasswordAuthenticator` - uses the OAuth API (so higher rate limits), but requires a registered account and registration on the 'apps' page (see below). Choose this for **bots** or scripts that use lots of data."],["client","A client that represents one connection to the Reddit API. This can log in to one account or remain anonymous, and performs all interactions with the Reddit API. # Examples ## Creating a RedditClient When creating a `RedditClient`, you are only required to pass in a user agent string, which will identify your client. The user agent should identify your program, but does not need to be unique to this particular machine - you should use one user agent for each version of your program.
